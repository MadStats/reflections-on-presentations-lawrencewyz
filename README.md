# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation: 
Fragile Families

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The data is really interesting in my opnion, and I do like how the team put in effort to explain the data that they have. Since the amount of predictors is large and could be confusing.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
I'm a bit concerned about the fact that the analysis does not seem to support the thesis. In addition, the relationship between interested predictors and the goal of the project is not clearly identified in my opnion.




Title of presentation:
Mass Shooting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
I like how the states are divided into multiple categories where each represents a different opinion and behavior towards purchasing guns. Also, the gun purchase graphs for some of the states are really interesting to see. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
It is not clear that how the media coverage is decided. Based on the group's answers, it seems like the news that considered were only the ones that appeared on the internet. However, in my opnion, TV news coverage also play a significant role in affecting people's thoughts towards guns. Therefore, I think it is probably for the best to also include such data if it is possible. In addition, the states' political preferences towards the guns might also play a huge role in affecting the account of gun purchases.




Title of presentation:
Voting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The in-depth analysis of all aspects of the data is interesting, and the end goal of this project seems interesting as well since it could be used to target specific groups in different states in the upcoming elections.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
To me, the thesis of the project isn't clear. I feel like the group has a lot of ideas, but it does not have a specific focus and the ideas are not put together in an organized way.






Title of presentation:
Yelp

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
I like the text analysis part of the project, where the characteristics of a bad dining experience is clearly identified. Also, the objectivity for each rating seems interesting.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
In my opinion, the thesis needs more work, and with all the outcomes, there is not a sense of purpose clearly stated. For example, I think it could be focusing on adjusting the weight of the scores based the geographical movements, since the group mentioned that the further someone travels, the lower the score gets.






Title of presentation:
Chicago Crime

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The idea of putting the whole Chicago area into multiple different blocks is rather interesting, since the detailed infortmation for each block might be helpful for the analysis.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
It wasn't clear to me that how the number of restaurants or daycares can affect the number of crimes. I think it might be better if the team uses some factors that might be representative such as income, race and so on. 



Title of presentation:
Games

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The hope for identifing the potential ways to win the game is really interesting to start with.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
It is not clear that how the models work, or even what are the variable that the group is interested in. Many terms need more explaination as well. The goal of the project seems a bit disorganized.



Title of presentation:
H1B(Our Group)



Title of presentation:
Car Accident

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The analysis for this project is thorough, and the amount of data that used for this project is very large.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
All the plots that included in this presentation are the residuals plots, using more meaning for this analysis and presentation might be more interesting.



Title of presentation:
Songs

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The idea that analysing songs, and the use of applying all the sources that pulling from all kinds of directions. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
The uses of the resources do not seem to be clear, and a detailed thesis statement might be needed since it was shown clearly in the presentation.


Title of presentation:
NBA

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The data for the players are really interesting. In addition, the heat map for the player to monitor his movement throughout the game is pretty amazing!

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
First, the overtime is when the true star really shines, so could that hurt your analysis? The focus of the this project is yet be clarified. Seems to me that the team is a bit unsure which factors are the important ones.


Title of presentation:
Terrorism

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The animation that shows the change over time looks really cool, and it does help with noticing some interesting changes throughout the time.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
When choosing interested factors, is there any better way to do such thing? Since I think choosing the factors voluntarily would hurt the results of the analysis.
